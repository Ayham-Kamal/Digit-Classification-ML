# Digit-Classification-ML
This is a machine learning project I developed to classify digits (1-9) from images using various ML models. I Preprocessed image datasets for feature extraction and scaling, trained classification models (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks), and visualized performance using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.
